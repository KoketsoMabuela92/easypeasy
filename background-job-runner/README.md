# EasyPeasy Background Job Runner

EasyPeasy is a custom background job runner built with Laravel. It allows you to run PHP classes as independent jobs, bypassing Laravel's built-in queue system. This project focuses on flexibility, error handling, and providing advanced features for monitoring and managing background jobs.

- **Custom Job Runner:** Execute PHP classes as standalone jobs.
- **Retry Mechanism:** Automatically retry failed jobs based on configurable logic.
- **Timeout Support:** Handle long-running jobs with customizable timeouts.
- **Prioritization:** Assign priorities to jobs for controlled execution order.
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging for job dispatch, retries, and completion.
- **Extensible Design:** Add more features, such as a web-based dashboard, with ease.

## Usage

1. **Running Jobs**

You can create and dispatch custom jobs using the runBackgroundJob method.

Example:

```bash
    use App\Jobs\GenerateReportJob;
    
    // Dispatch a simple job
    php artisan job:run "App\Jobs\GenerateReportJob" handle
    
    // Dispatch a job with parameters
    php artisan job:run "App\Jobs\GenerateReportJob" handle [] 1 3 5
    
    // Dispatch a job with retry logic
    php artisan job:run "App\Jobs\GenerateReportJob" handle [] 1 3 5
```

2. **Logging**

   Logs for dispatched jobs, retries, and completions are available in the Laravel log files (storage/logs/laravel.log) & (storage/logs/background_jobs_status.log) and also for job errors, in (storage/logs/background_jobs_errors.log).



3. **Web Interface**

Execute the below artisan command, then visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard` for view the jobs and their statuses, cancel running jobs, and also retry failed jobs.
```bash
    php artisan serve
```
